# User Suspension System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The Blood Donation System now includes a comprehensive user suspension feature that allows administrators to temporarily or permanently restrict user access with full audit trails and automatic expiration.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Suspension Fields** added to `users` table:
  - `is_suspended` (Boolean) - Current suspension status
  - `suspended_until` (DateTime) - Expiration timestamp (NULL for permanent)
  - `suspension_reason` (Text) - Admin-provided reason
  - `suspended_by` (Integer) - Admin ID who performed the action

### 2. User Model Methods
- `suspend(duration_hours, reason, admin_id)` - Suspend user with duration
- `unsuspend(admin_id)` - Remove suspension
- `is_currently_suspended()` - Check active suspension status
- `get_suspension_time_remaining()` - Calculate remaining time

### 3. Admin Interface

#### Admin Users List (`admin_users.html`)
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators showing "Active" (green) or "Suspended" (red)
- **Quick Actions Dropdown**: 
  - Suspend options (1 hour to 1 year)
  - Unsuspend option for suspended users
  - Direct access to user details

#### User Details View (`admin_view_user.html`)
- **Suspension Status Panel**: Shows current status with remaining time
- **Suspension History**: Complete audit trail of all suspension actions
- **Action Buttons**:
  - "Suspend User" with duration selection modal
  - "Unsuspend User" with confirmation modal
- **Detailed Information**: Shows who suspended, when, why, and until when

### 4. Administrative Controls

#### Suspension Modal Features
- **Duration Selection**: Dropdown with predefined options:
  - 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours
  - 1 day, 3 days, 1 week
  - 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year
  - Permanent (no expiration)
- **Reason Field**: Required text field for documentation
- **Confirmation**: Clear warnings about suspension effects

#### Admin Route (`admin_toggle_user_status`)
- **Parameter Validation**: Ensures valid actions and durations
- **Duration Mapping**: Converts friendly names to hours
- **Audit Logging**: Records all suspension actions
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and user feedback

### 5. Security Features

#### Access Control
- **Login Blocking**: Suspended users cannot log in
- **Session Termination**: Active sessions are invalidated
- **API Protection**: All protected routes check suspension status

#### Automatic Expiration
- **Background Processing**: Suspensions expire automatically
- **Real-time Checking**: Status verified on each login attempt
- **Clean Expiration**: Suspended users regain access exactly when intended

#### Audit Trail
- **Complete Logging**: All suspension/unsuspension actions recorded
- **Admin Attribution**: Every action tied to specific admin
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Precise timing of all actions
- **Reason Documentation**: Required justification for all suspensions

### 6. User Experience

#### For Suspended Users
- **Clear Messaging**: Informative error messages explaining suspension
- **Time Information**: Shows when suspension will be lifted (if applicable)
- **Contact Information**: Guidance on how to appeal or get help

#### For Administrators
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use suspension controls
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear status indicators throughout the system
- **Bulk Actions**: Quick suspension options from user lists
- **Detailed Views**: Complete suspension history and status

## Technical Implementation

- Safely adds all required fields with proper defaults
- Backward compatible with existing user data

### Model Updates
- Enhanced `User` model in `models.py`
- Proper datetime handling with timezone awareness
- Efficient database queries for suspension checks

### Template Integration
- Bootstrap-styled modals and forms
- AJAX-ready for future enhancements

### Route Enhancements
- Robust parameter validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Flash messages for user feedback

## Usage Examples
